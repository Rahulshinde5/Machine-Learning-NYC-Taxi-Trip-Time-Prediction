# NYC Taxi Trip Time Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the trip time for taxi rides in New York City using machine learning regression techniques. By accurately estimating the duration of a taxi trip, valuable insights can be provided to both taxi service providers and passengers.

## Methods Used
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Machine learning regression

## Dataset
- The NYC Taxi Trip Time Prediction dataset contains information about taxi trips in New York City.
- Sourced from the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission.
- Dataset comprises 1,458,644 rows and 11 columns.
- No missing or duplicate values in the dataset.

## Code and Notebooks
- Access the Colab notebook [here](https://github.com/Rahulshinde5/Machine-Learning-NYC-Taxi-Trip-Time-Prediction/blob/main/NYC_Taxi_Trip_Time_Prediction_Regression_Capstone_Project.ipynb).
- The notebook includes step-by-step implementation of data preprocessing, EDA, feature engineering, and model building.

## Results and Visualizations
- Discovered insights from exploratory data analysis.
- Visualized patterns, distributions, and correlations among variables.
- Achieved high model performance with regression models.
